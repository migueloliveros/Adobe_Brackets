        <h1>XXI century slavery in Post Colonial Europe</h1>
        <p> Now a days, trafficking in human beings (THB) is a contemporary form of de facto  slavery. A transnational activity & movement.
        </p>
        <h2>Transnational activity & movements.</h2>
        <p>“It is important to consider the nature of transnational movements, the extent of their penetration, and the conditions that make it harder or easier for states to control them. But the adequate study of these matters, like others, requires finding or developing an adequate approach to the study of international politics (…). The study of transnational movements deals with important factual questions, which theories can help one to cope with it”

(K. N. Waltz 1979: 95).
